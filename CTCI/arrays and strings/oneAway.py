"""
One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert
          a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two 
          strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edit away)

Example
pale, ple --> True
pales, pale --> True
pale, bale --> True
pale, bake --> False
