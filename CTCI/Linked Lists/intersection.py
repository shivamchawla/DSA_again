"""
Intersection : Given two (singly) linkedlists, determine if the two lists
               intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection
               is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node
               of the first linkedlist is the exact same node(by reference) as the 
               jth node of the second linkedlist, then thet are intersecting.
