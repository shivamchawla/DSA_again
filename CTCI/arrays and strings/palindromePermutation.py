"""
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a 
                        permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word 
                        or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
                        A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The 
                        palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary
                        words.

Example
Input : Tact Coa
Output : True (permutations: 'taco cat', 'atco cta', etc)

# Method 1: Using dictionary, frequency of n-1 letters are even and the remaining
#           can have odd number of letters ?
