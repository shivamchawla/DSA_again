Sum Lists : You have two numbers represented by a linkedlist, where each node
            contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such
            that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds
            the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list
            
Example
Input: (7->1->6) + (5->9->2), that is, 617+295
Output: 2->1->9, that is, 912

Follow up: Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem
Example
Input : (6->1->7) + (2->9->5), that is, 617+295
Output: 9->1->2. That is, 912.
