Partition : Write code to partition a linkedlist around a value x, such that all
            nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.
            If x is contained within the list, the value of x only need to be 
            after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear 
            anywhere in the right partition, it does not need to appear between
            the left and right partition

Example
Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition=5]
output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5-> 8
