URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may
        assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the 
        additional characters, and that you are given the 'true' length of the
        string.
         
Example
input: 'Mr John Smith     ', 13 
output: 'Mr%20John%20Smith'
